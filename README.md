chamber
=======

This program is a simple toy to allow visualization of different
conditions when chambering a rifle round.  There are a bewildering
variety of factors that may contribute to safety issues, affect
accuracy, or even generate confusion when discussing such things on
the Internet.

This software presents the user with some options for rendering an
image of a chambered round.  Many of the variables in chamber
dimensions, reloading parameters, and error conditions can be
manipulated by the user. 

The software is written for the [Processing](http://www.processing.org)
programming environment (thus, Java).
